Hello, and thank you for visiting my website! I am a Master's student at Texas A&M University interested in tensors and algebraic geometry. I have a strong foundation in algebra (I passed my [Fall 2022 Qualifying Exam](https://www.math.tamu.edu/graduate/phd/quals.html)), and I have a good background in complex analysis/topology. I have so much to learn and am very excited to do so!

If you are here for resources to help prepare for your algebra qualifier, I have prepared a 50 page document [here](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1OYeJgUoyi0-SlrUraLvXyzm50vMapf8g) that contains solutions to the _Modules_ section of Thomas Hungerford's _Algebra_. Solutions to some other sections already exist and can be found [here](http://site.iugaza.edu.ps/mashker/files/2010/02/sol-manual-hungeford.pdf) courtesy of James Wilson.

My academic plans for Spring 2023 include:

- I will be taking a second-semester algebraic geometry and differential geometry course.
- The book _Tensors: Geometry and Applications_ by J.M. Landsberg is a wonderful text which initiated my enthusiasm for tensors. I will go through the technical heart of the book with the guidance of Professor Landsberg via a reading course.
- Amusingly, I am also the owner of the domain "mathgre.com". In 2021, I started an ambitious project to create a massive tutorial center targeted at students preparing for the GRE mathematics test. Unsurprisingly, making videos specifically tailored for the types of questions you'll see in each subject takes a long time; its development also stagnated for a bit since I learned React to actually start constructing the website's skeleton. I will continue working on this next semester and (hopefully) provide regular updates on its progress.
- I think the amount of current resources that prepare students for the TAMU algebra qualifier are significantly less than for the other quals, so I hope to create more material for that.
- I will complete my Master's degree in the spring, so I need to prepare for my final exam.

Other than the above, the main purpose of this website is to compile some of my non-academic personal projects or miscellaneous things I find interesting. Currently, none of these are actually posted here, but they will be soon as I hope to make regular updates to the site. My other hobbies are composing/solving chess puzzles, teaching and practicing techniques to do mental math quickly, playing the piano, and pretty much any sports-related things.
